Pypilot is an autopilot _system_. It has multiple components that can be configured in more than one way. To understand pypilot, it is necessary to identify and describe the different components. For the sake of explaining pypilot, these components are first explicitly named and described at a high level:
* The _software component_;
* The _hardware component_; and
* The _user interface component_.

After we've done that, we will describe everything one level deeper. Then, with two levels of understanding in our pocket, we will dive into the real thing, gettings things working and filling the gap between grass-roots reality and the conceptual understanding we're now about to build. After that, you have seen it all once, and then we can have little specialistic chapters for the real pypilot lovers.
